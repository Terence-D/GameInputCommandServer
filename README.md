# NEW LINK New Version 2.0 alpha - NEW LINK
https://github.com/Terence-D/GamingInterfaceCommandServer 

Started a new repo as this is a full rewrite - same license and same features as the old verison, just switching to a multi project Net Core project to eventually make it cross platform (half of it technically already is in its current form)

# Gaming Input Command Server (Windows)
Windows server for the Gaming Interface Client

## Guide
 https://github.com/Terence-D/GameInputCommandServer/wiki

## Description
This is part of a  two app system that allows the use of a remote device (Tablet or Phone) to provide input into a PC game or application.  This software is the Windows Server and runs on your Windows PC.  It talks to GIC for Android - https://github.com/Terence-D/GamingInterfaceClientAndroid/wiki and will accept commands from it and pass it off to whatever application or game you have set it for.  For example if you play a space simulator, you can add custom buttons for Comms, Warp Drive, Power control, etc and have it accessible at your fingertips without remembering complex keystrokes.

## Features
* Open Source and Free!
* Simple http based connection, making it easy for people to write their own clients
* Supports multiple devices connecting to the server.  Use one Tablet for your ship Systems, another for Comms!
* Supports practically any game
* More features to be worked on!
